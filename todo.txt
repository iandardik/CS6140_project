PCD / BGD
-1. understand the analytical sol for L1 norm
-2. lasso w/PCD
-3. elastic net w/PCD
4. L.5 and L4 w/PCD.  Do either have a closed form solution (like Ridge)?
5. cross validation
6. Implement everything for BGD
7. create 3 data sets (n<p, n=p, n>p)
8. results (both of us will analyize)

Other things to explore:
1. wild elastic net
2. Huber loss
3. fused lasso https://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.1485.pdf
4. shooting CD / recursive PCD (cyclical)

Another cool direction: classification
1. ROC evaluation
2. logistic (probably probit) regression?

later
1. compare algorithms to library
2. use heat map to show how our results vary as the relationship between n & p varies
