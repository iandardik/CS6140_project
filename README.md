# CS6140_project TODO list

## PCD / BGD
* ~~understand the analytical sol for L1 norm~~
* ~~lasso w/PCD~~
* ~~elastic net w/PCD~~
* L.5 and L4 w/PCD.  Do either have a closed form solution (like Ridge)?
* cross validation
* Implement everything for BGD
* create 3 data sets (n<p, n=p, n>p)
* results (both of us will analyize)

## Other things to explore:
* wild elastic net
* Huber loss
* fused lasso https://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.1485.pdf
* shooting CD / recursive PCD (cyclical)

## Another cool direction: classification
* ROC evaluation
* logistic (probably probit) regression?

## later
* compare algorithms to library
* use heat map to show how our results vary as the relationship between n & p varies
